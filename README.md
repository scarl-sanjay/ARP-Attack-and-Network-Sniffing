# Explore Network Sniffing and ARP Attacks

# AIM:

To explore network sniffing and ARP Attacks

## STEPS:

### Step 1:

Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode

### Step 2:

Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows:


### Step 3:
Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## ARP Attacks:  
ARP spoofing: A hacker sends fake ARP packets that link an attacker's MAC address with an IP of a computer already on the LAN. 
Boot kali and Windows7 virtual machines.
In windows 7 give the command arp -a
## OUTPUT:
From kali linux issue the command :
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t <target system> <gateway>
